# Publication format is a subset of distribution.
pulp_publication_rpm: "{{ pulp_distribution_rpm }}"

# This version is appended to the name of distributions, and used as the last
# part of the path of the directory containing the distribution.
# FIXME: The following version is taken at the time when facts are gathered.
#        Ideally it would relate to the time the repository version was
#        created, since this would ensure they are ordered by the time of the
#        sync, rather than the time of the distribution was created. This
#        matters if we make a distribution for an earlier repository version,
#        when later ones have already been distributed. Alternatively we could
#        forget ordering and use a random string.
